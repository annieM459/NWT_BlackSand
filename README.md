# Early Snow Melt Impact Analysis at Niwot Ridge

## Introduction
Welcome to the Early Snow Melt Impact Analysis project, focusing on an alpine site at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. This project is centered around the Black Sands experiment, where black sand was added to simulate early snowmelt. Our aim is to understand the cascading effects of this environmental manipulation on the alpine ecosystem.

## Objective
Our primary objective is to detect potential shifts across the landscape in plants, microbes, and mycorrhizae due to early snow melt. By analyzing various ecological covariates, we hope to gain insights into how these critical components of the alpine ecosystem respond to changing environmental conditions.

## Methodology
### Data Collection
- **Site Description:** Our study focuses on specific sites within Niwot Ridge where the Black Sands experiment has been conducted.
- **Covariate Gathering:** We employ remote sensing and ground-truthing methods to gather data on various ecological covariates, including terrain measurements, soil temperature, moisture levels, and snowmelt.

### Data Analysis
- **Analytical Approach:** Utilizing statistical and geospatial analysis tools, we aim to correlate changes in snowmelt patterns with shifts in plant species distribution, microbial activity, and mycorrhizal network dynamics.

## Expected Outcomes
We anticipate revealing significant ecological shifts, including changes in plant species prevalence, alterations in microbial community compositions, and adaptations in mycorrhizal networks. These outcomes will contribute valuable data on the impacts of climate change on alpine ecosystems.

## Contribution
This project adds to the growing body of knowledge on climate change effects in high-altitude environments. It is crucial for developing strategies to manage and protect these sensitive ecosystems under changing climatic conditions.
